# 🎯 Enhanced Features - Hireflow Phase 1.5

## What's New?

### ✨ Improved UX Flow
- **Separate Authentication & Job Search**: Users now sign up/login first, then use "Find Jobs" button on dashboard
- **Resume Upload Modal**: Clean modal interface for uploading resume or entering skills manually
- **Smart Dashboard**: Shows personalized greeting and current skills

### 🤖 AI-Powered Job Matching (Gemini Integration)

#### Enhanced Accuracy
The system now uses **Google Gemini AI** to:
1. **Extract skills from resume** automatically using NLP
2. **Identify job categories** (e.g., "Software Development", "Data Science")
3. **Expand search terms** to related keywords and synonyms

#### Example Improvement:
- **Before**: Searching for "React JS, Next JS" → 0 results
- **After**: AI expands to ["React", "Next.js", "JavaScript", "Frontend Development", "Web Development", "UI Development", "Software Development"] → Many relevant results!

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. **Sign up** (just name, email, password)
2. **Login** → redirected to Dashboard
3. **Click "Find Jobs"** → Modal appears
4. **Upload Resume OR Enter Skills**:
   - If resume: AI extracts skills automatically
   - If manual: Enter comma-separated skills
5. **Jobs automatically load** filtered by your skills
6. **Click "View"** on any job to apply

### Behind the Scenes:
```
Resume Upload → Gemini AI → Extract Skills & Categories
                                    ↓
User Skills: ["react", "node"] → Gemini Expansion
                                    ↓
Expanded: ["react", "node", "javascript", "frontend", "web development", "full stack"]
                                    ↓
Filter Remotive Jobs → Display Matches
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Optional: Disable AI (fallback mode)
If you don't set `GEMINI_API_KEY`, the system:
- Still works with basic keyword matching
- No AI expansion, just direct skill matching
- Logs warning: "GEMINI_API_KEY not set, using basic extraction"

### Recommended: Enable AI
For best results, add Gemini API key to get:
- Automatic skill extraction from resumes
- Smart search term expansion
- Better job matching accuracy

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Gemini API**: ~2-3 seconds per resume analysis
- **Job Filtering**: ~100ms for 1000+ jobs
- **Cache**: Remotive jobs cached for 10 minutes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No jobs found"
- Check if skills were extracted (look in browser console)
- Try manual skills entry
- Verify Gemini API key is valid

### Gemini API errors
- Check quota: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Ensure API key has Gemini API enabled
- Fallback: System still works without AI
